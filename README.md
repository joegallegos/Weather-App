### Worth Going Outside?

- The idea behind this application is I want to be able to have a quick glance at the site or mobile app / push notification at specific time (maybe ?) to see if it is worth going outside and setting up my camera gear for astrophotography.

- I have a general idea of what I want to do, but nothing exactly solid just yet.

- I plan to use Next.Js / TailwindCSS / and the weather api as a base.
